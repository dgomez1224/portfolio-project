     <h2> About David</h2>
     <p>I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a Global Studies major. After graduating, I worked as a personal trainer. Although I intended to pursue a career in physical therapy I decided to shift career paths.</p>
     <p>I am excited to study at Thinkful and gain engineering skills that will help me advance in the field.</p>
     <p>Outside of web development I enjoy travelling to and learning about new places around the world. I am also a musician, playing the electric bass as a hobby.  </p>
